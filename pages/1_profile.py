Hi, I'm **Sameer Shaik**, a graduate student in Computer Science at George Washington University with a passion for building impactful software using AI, machine learning, and intelligent automation. I've participated in 13 hackathons across the U.S. — winning HackPSU and YHacks — and currently serve as the Lead Organizer and Technical Director of George Hacks, where I recently organized a 300-participant hackathon and secured 3 sponsors. With a perfect 4.0 GPA, 3 U.S. internships, and 5 strong letters of recommendation, I’m committed to continuous growth and solving real-world problems through tech.

My interests currently are span from AI Agents and LLM-powered applications to cybersecurity and automation. I've worked on gesture detection for deaf education, LLM-driven chat systems, and 3D interactive web designs using Three.js. I’m always exploring the intersection of creativity and technology — and I’m excited about opportunities that let me blend innovation, community building, and technical depth.
