# 🔍 Streamlit Demo: Profile Page

This is a simple Streamlit demo app created to test how well Streamlit can handle and render complex `.py` files, particularly those involving **machine learning workflows**. 

## 💡 Purpose

I'm using this minimal profile page as a starting point to evaluate:
- Streamlit's support for complex ML pipeline files
- Its responsiveness and performance
- How well it can serve interactive components for future ML-powered apps

This test will guide the development of my next major project, where I plan to integrate **AI Agents**, **LLMs**, and advanced **real-time feedback systems** into a clean and interactive frontend using Streamlit.

## 📄 What's Included

- Personal profile display using `st.markdown()` and `st.write()`
- Basic layout testing for multi-paragraph content
- Test structure to simulate how future ML app modules might be organized
